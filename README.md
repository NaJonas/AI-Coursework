# Task 1

The algorithms are in a class called: GridEnvironment
Create a new object: test = GridEnviroment(n, m) the size of the matrix
To call the simple algorithm: test.stupidAlgorithm(), returns the shortest path value
To call the dijkstra: test.dijkstra(), return the shortest path value. You can uncomment the print at the end of dijkstra method for printing shortest paths for all cells.

The ant colony optimization doesn't work.
